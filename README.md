# Description

Squamatabase is a database of prey items recorded in diet samples 
from the world's snakes, compiled by [me](https://blueraleigh.github.io), during
my time as a PhD student at the University of Michigan.

# Data archives

Each new release (corresponding to the addition of new data or new
functionality) is archived in the Zenodo data repository and receives
a [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3667777). Users who simply
want the raw data without bothering with package installation can download
the [diet.csv](https://github.com/blueraleigh/squamatabase/blob/master/inst/diet.csv) file in the inst/ directory. The current archive contains
around 30,000 predator-prey records sampled from around the world and many different
snake lineages. Each point on the globe below represents a georeferenced
predation event, and the bar graph to the left shows the snake family level
distribution of those records.

# Installation

Squamatabase can be installed from an R session using the following
command

```r
remotes::install_github("blueraleigh/squamatabase")
```

Alternatively, the tarball for this repository can be downloaded and 
installed via R CMD INSTALL.

# Getting started

```r
library(squamatabase)

# For a list of available functions
?squamatabase

# For documentation of database structure
?diet
```

```r
# To load the full record set we can do ...
data(diet)

# ... or we can do
diet = squamatabase::filter_records()
```

```r
# To reproduce the graph above:

# Fetch the full record set
diet = squamatabase::filter_records()

# Filter the record set to weed out any miscellaneous non-snakes
diet = squamatabase::filter_records(diet, predator_taxon="Serpentes")

# Collapse all identified snakes to the level of taxonomic family
diet = squamatabase::collapse_ranks(diet, "family")

# Compute family-level counts
counts = pmin(diet$predator_count, diet$prey_count, na.rm=TRUE)
family_counts = sort(tapply(counts, diet$predator, sum, na.rm=TRUE))

# Database compilation

I compiled Squamatabase from numerous articles published in
scientific journals. I located material both through the use of
keyword queries in academic search engines and by systematic
review of table of contents for well-known herpetological journals
(e.g. Herpetological Review, Herpetology Notes). I also located
additional relevant articles by consulting the references in
reviewed articles. My goal was simply to track down as many
relevant sources as possible. The current compilation includes
data from approximately 1700 different sources but remains
incomplete in many ways (e.g., geographically and taxonomically).

The majority of observations in the database result from papers
describing (1) dissections of fluid preserved museum specimens and
(2) direct encounters with snakes in the field that were actively
consuming a prey or had recently consumed a prey item that could
be regurgitated by forced palpation. Glaudas et al. (2017) have
noted that these sources of information can provide different
pictures of the prey spectrum for Bitis arietans (Puff Adder).

# Database fields

Each record in the database describes a snake specimen eating or
attempting to eat a prey specimen. Note that due to the nature of
the published data a "specimen" does not necessarily correspond to
a single individual. In all cases, however, a specimen refers to a
set of individuals that belong to the same taxon. The following
fields are associated with each record:

- predator_verbatim
    
    The scientific name of the predator as reported
    by the original authors.

- predator 

    The scientific name the predator according to the 2016
    Catalogue of Life taxonomy.

- predator_rank 

    The Linnean rank of the predator. Typically this
    will be "species" or "infraspecies".

- predator_taxon 
    
    A semicolon separated list of the higher taxonomic
    names that apply to the predator.

- predator_count 

    The number of individual predator organisms
    involved in the interaction.

- predator_voucher 

    A unique identifier for the specimen that is
    either (1) a bona fide museum voucher number or (2) a
    randomly generated alphanumeric code. The rationale for this
    field is that same predator specimen may have eaten multiple
    prey specimens that carry unique identifying information
    (e.g. taxonomic identities, distinct ages, etc.), in which
    case each prey specimen requires its own row, thus
    necessitating duplication of the predator specimen across
    rows. Having a unique identifier for the predator specimen
    allows one to identify the same predator specimen appearing
    in multiple rows, although this rarely happens due to the
    tendency of snakes to only have a single prey item in their
    gut. A caveat needs to be mentioned. In many cases, the
    results of museum studies are reported in summarized tabular
    form. For example, a museum study of snake X may report that
    12 specimens had eaten 14 individuals of prey Y and that 8
    specimens had eaten 8 individuals of prey Z. These data will
    be represented in SquamataBase as two rows, and each row will
    have a unique randomly generated predator_voucher. This is
    because there is no way, without further information, to know
    whether any of the individuals eating prey Y also ate prey Z.

- predator_sex 

    The sex of the specimen. Typically only used when the
    predator_count field is 1.

- predator_age 

    The age of the specimen.Typically only used when the
    predator_count field is 1.

- predator_svl 

    The snout-vent-length (in mm) of the specimen.
    Typically only used when the predator_count field is 1.

- predator_tl 

    The total length (in mm) of the specimen. Typically
    only used when the predator_count field is 1.

- predator_mass 

    The mass (in grams) of the specimen. Typically only
    used when the predator_count field is 1.

**NOTE**

All of the above fields with the exception of the svl field
are also recorded for the prey specimen, and hence take the
prefix "prey". Additionally, the following field is unique to
the prey specimen:

- prey_ingested 

    The orientation in which the prey specimen was
    swallowed. Typically only used when the prey_count field is
    1.

- locality_adm0_name 

    The country where the predation event occurred.

- locality_adm1_name 

    The state where the predation event occurred.

- locality_adm2_name 

    The county where the predation event occurred.

- locality_longitude 

    Decimal longitude where the predation event occurred.

- locality_latitude 

    Decimal latitude where the predation event occurred.

- event_basis 

    Evidentiary basis for the reported predation event.
    Typically "direct_observation" or "dissected_gut_contents".

- event_setting 

    A note indicating whether the predation event was
    observed in a natural or a captive setting. Almost all
    records in the database are recorded from natural settings.
    Observations resulting from dissections of museum specimens
    are assumed to have occurred in a natural setting.

- event_date 

    YYYY-MM-DD formatted date when the predation event was
    observed. If the observation resulted from an examination of
    gut contents this field is the collection date of the
    specimen.

- event_start 

    HH:MM formatted time when the predation event was
    first noted, measured on a 24 hour clock to avoid AM and PM
    designations.

- event_end 

    HH:MM formatted time when the predation event ended,
    measured on a 24 hour clock to avoid AM and PM designations.

- event_outcome 

    If the predation event was successful this field
    takes the value "prey_eaten". This is always the case if the
    observation is based on dissections of museum specimens.
    However, for observations based on encounters with snakes in
    the field other outcomes are possible and the values in this
    field are self-explanatory (e.g.
    "predation_interrupted_by_observer").

- event_habitat 

    A simple habitat descriptor indicating whether the
    predation occurred in a terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal, or
    aquatic setting.

- event_habitat_verbatim 

    Habitat description in the words of the
    original authors.

- event_remark 

    Miscellaneous narrative information regarded as
    potentially relevant.

- reference 

    Bibliographic citation to the original source of the
    record.
